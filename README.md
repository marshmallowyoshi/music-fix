# Music Fixer

Just a place for me to store various scripts for changing/repairing tags in my music library

## Perform and Display Artist Fix

A difference in the way MusicBee handles artist tags, with "Diplay Artist", "Artist" and "Artist: Performer" ruins artist tags for other music players. Will make a script that can detect if a file has this issue and resolve it while retaining the artist information.
